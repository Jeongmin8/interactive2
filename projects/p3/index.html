                        <div class="con conn1">The Knocker-Upper<br><span>Before the invention of alarm clocks, which we all take for granted these days, people needed to make sure they got up on time for work.The task fell to someone called a knocker-upper, who would walk around the streets tapping on the windows of people who paid for a wake up call. It was a job done in the dark, the cold, and the rough streets of major cities.</span></div>
                    </li>
                    <li id="s3" class="three">
                        <div class="con conn2">The Lamp Lighter<br><span>Before electric lights were standard, streets were lit by gas lamps. As you might imagine, someone was needed to manually light these lamps. Lamp lighters used long ladders to reach the lamps, and then used matches to light the lamps. With electric street lights illuminating the night, lamplighters are obsolete.</span></div>

                        <div class="con conn3">The Pinsetter<br><span>When you go bowling, a machine comes down and clears away the fallen pins, and sets up new pins. Before the arrival of automation, though, boys and girls did this job. While these pinsetters were often teenagers, sometimes they were much younger. Now, there is no need to have someone set up the pins, although the manager may need to go behind if the machine gets stuck.</span></div>
                    </li>
                    <li id="s5" class="five">
                        <div class="con conn4">The Ice Cutter<br><span>To keep food properly cold, an icebox used to be required. And for an icebox, you needed ice. However, you couldn’t just find it at any store. Instead, it was cut from frozen lakes and rivers. Before refrigeration, ice was cut by men who worked hard to get it out of the frozen north. Then the ice was delivered around the country.</span></div>

                    <li id="s6" class="six">
                        <div class="con conn5">The Copy Boy<br><span>Errand runners used to take paper from desk to desk in newspaper offices around the country. When reports came out of teletype machines from the news wire services, copy boys would take the mimeographed information, sort it and then deliver it. Then, when a story was done, the copy boys could collect the article and take it to an editor. Now it’s all done via document sharing and e-mail.</span></div>
                    </li>
                    <li id="s7" class="seven">
                        <div class="con conn6">The Scrivener<br><span>Sometimes referred to as a "scribe," scriveners made a living by writing and copying court and legal documents, and other written material. They were common in places where literacy rates were very low, and were also responsible for duties including dictation, petitions, and reading letters out loud to clients.
Technology, such as photocopying machines and tape recorders, made the scrivener extinct in all but the very poorest parts of the world.</span></div>

                        <div class="con conn7">The Newspaper Typesetter<br><span>Individual pieces of type used to have to be placed in printing presses in order to create newspaper pages and other documents on a mass scale. Now, of course, computers do the work of layout for newspapers, automating the process so that it is done more quickly, and arguably more accurately.</span></div>

                         <div class="con conn8">The Switchboard operator<br><span>From the late 1800s up until the 1960s, switchboard operators were the reason you were able to make a call. The job was hectic and mundane, requiring dexterity and nimble fingers to connect lines via a switchboard that had a dizzying number of jacks, plugs, and cords. If you've ever seen an old movie with someone using a candlestick phone, you'll hear them ask the operator to connect them to a number.That was the job, day in, day out. In the 1920s, automated exchanges started being developed. Now, technology has completely eliminated the need for switchboard operators.</span></div>

                        <div class="con conn9">The Elevator Operator<br><span>It used to be that elevators needed someone to manually operate them, often using levers to help keep things moving as efficiently as possible, and to properly land the elevator cab on the correct floor. Even after buttons were created to help, an operator was still required, since the buttons didn’t allow for extra stops. Now, of course, push button operation makes this job unnecessary.</span></div>

                         <div class="con conn10">The Mimeograph Operator<br><span>It used to be that the process of creating mimeographs was sometimes given to an operator. This allowed copies to made while the person requesting them accomplished other tasks. Now, though, mimeographs have been replaced by all sorts of digital machines, and the simple push of a button from a computer can get someone all the copies he or she needs.</span></div>

                        <div class="con conn10">The Dictaphone Operator<br><span>Company executives and other important people often dictated memos, letters and other documents using a Dictaphone. A Dictaphone operator would listen through headphones and type what he or she heard. Dictaphones are no longer needed, with more convenient digital recorders. There are even some programs that transcribe automatically, without the need for someone to type.</span></div>

                        <div class="history">History<span><br>When the Oakland Museum of California (OMCA) first opened its doors more than forty years ago, it brought together three historically independent disciplines—art, history, and natural sciences—under one roof. This progressive multidisciplinary approach was to celebrate the many facets of California. Our collections—comprising more than 1.9 million objects including seminal art works, historical artifacts, ethnographic objects, natural specimens, and photographs—and our programs explore and reveal the factors that shape California character and identity, from its extraordinary natural landscapes, to successive waves of migration, to its unique culture of creativity and innovation.</span></div>

                        <div class ="pink">OMCA has reopened its galleries after a transformation that touches almost every aspect of the 300,000 square-foot Museum and builds on the founders' original multidisciplinary and civic-minded intent by improving integration of OMCA's collections and programs, strengthening its role as a public forum, and creating new opportunities for visitor participation. The collections are animated by innovative interpretive tools and interactive features; and new gathering spaces and program areas engage visitors and encourage them to share their own perspectives, questions, and stories.

                        OMCA nurtures its deep ties to the community by offering many educational and outreach programs. We welcome schools, scholars, local audiences, and all visitors to participate in our events and activities and to discover their place in California's past, present, and future.
